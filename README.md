# `<rant>`

I've never been fond of the ridiculous "interview coding questions/problems"
that get asked when trying to find a software engineer job. From my perspective,
in my 10 year span of being a self-taught full-stack web developer across
several coding languages, I have yet to find any of these coding quiz's to be
something that can be used in a practical real-life setting. Very rarely have I
had the chance where the "coding test" during an interview felt like an actual
test of my skills; sadly the majority of my coding test chances have been more
pop-quiz style for obscure and never used problems. This part of the interview
tends to feel more like a "trolling" manager getting kicks out of making
applicants feel uncomfortable or stupid; they get a thrill out of stumping
people and completely miss the point of what you can find out during a coding
interview.

# The purpose of this repo

Perhaps I'm wrong about the **"Ridiculous"** quiz questions, perhaps the problem
lies in how the question is asked, the scenario of the question?

What I want to explore in this repo is if it's possible for the **"Ridiculous"**
to be converted **"To Practical"** circumstances.

The plus side of this repo is giving me practice at solving code quiz's, and
sharpening my mind on trying to apply what's I'm learning to be useable in the
real-world day-to-day life of being a software engineer. I also hope to be able
to work with experts in different areas of the software world to get insight on
why companies ask some of the questions they ask, how they think they can be
applied to real scenarios, and what they think could be done to make the coding
test portion of an interview better than it is.

Using my favorite Udemy instructor, Stephen Grider, I'll be going through his
**[The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WNk2@PUdgVFpSSFALckNGO0hOVD5u/)**
course so I can quickly get to the questions to solve and see answers/approaches
to those questions. If you're wanting to see more than the solutions I have in
this repo AND have the best teacher simplify the questions/solutions, you should
[check-out the course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WNk2@PUdgVFpSSFALckNGO0hOVD5u/), I highly recommend it!

I'm wanting to complete this course (all while improving my
skills), so this all works out. I'm hoping to do more than just go through the
course in JavaScript; I'm wanting to see how to solve these in my top 3
programming languages (Ruby, JavaScript, Go), and then see how to find a way to
make the question applicable... I'm hoping to find the practical possibilities
for these, as it'll greatly improve my skill set, and make it easier for me to
remember solutions to a problem (my mind works better against practical
real-life scenarios, than boring/memorization problems).

# Can Code Problems Be Categorized?

I categorize coding quiz's in one or more of the following:

## **Ridiculous**

The only purpose of these types of tests are one (or multiple) of the
following:

1. you're being trolled.
1. the interviewer has no idea what they're doing, and just Googled
   "coding test" and grabbed one without knowing what the test is for (or
   they themselves are being trolled by someone else who gave them this
   test).

### **The sub-types of "Ridiculous":**

#### **Tricky**

- the interviewer might want to see more than you using a built-in function, or
  perhaps they do and don't want to see you re-creating the wheel? You never
  know until you get it wrong (or if you're politely asked to not use a built-in
  solution, this is the ideal and is based on the mood of the interviewer).

#### **Vague**, **Overly Simplified**, or **Zero Context**

- This might be the source of all problems with coding quiz's? You can
  overly simplify and strip down a problem into this sort of problem,
  that's a good skill to have (for the interviewee) and should be
  considered as part of the problem; "can the candidate break down the
  problem into simple steps"?

#### **Stress-Test**

- the interviewer wants to see how you react under pressure; the solution is
  less about your coding ability (while that is also important), and more
  about how you take on and attempt to solve the problem.

#### **Never Need To Know This**

- My favorite quote of all-time is from a theoretical physicist (widely
  acknowledged as one of the greatest physicists of all time):

  > "I never commit to memory anything that can easily be looked up in a
  > book."
  >
  > -Albert Einstein

  We now have the internet with search engines... if it was easy to look
  things up in a book in Einsteins era, then it's at least thousands of
  times easier to look things up now via the internet.

  Unless you're trying to get a job where you'll be doing something like
  creating a new programming language or framework; doing programming in
  binary/machine; or [insert very low-level programming niche here]; or
  you're taking an actual "quiz/test" for a coding course that wants you to
  have memorized useless algorithms whose only purpose for memorization was
  "this exact test, and never again"... these kinds of coding quiz's are
  out-of-place for most scenarios.

  Who would ask you these kinds of questions?

  - an employer/interviewer who memorized this and are upset that no one
    else also waisted their time memorizing it... they're lonely, and want
    to find someone else just like them.
  - they're use to how the (ineffective) schooling system is setup, and
    don't know any other way to test someone besides how they've been
    tested their entire life.

#### **You Only Know The Answer if You Already Know The Answer**

- These are the "trick question"'s, the "I'm getting a laugh out of stumping
  you"'s. The only way to pass these quiz's is if you happen to have already
  seen the solution before hand.

## **Practical**

- These are the real deals, the type of questions and problems you'll be
  solving on a day-to-day basis. These questions test your actual skill and
  experience; they test how you react to problems; and they shed light on
  the way you work.
