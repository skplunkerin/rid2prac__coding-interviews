## A personal rant

<!-- begin-rant -->

I've never been fond of the coding questions/problems that many companies use
during interviews.

It goes a little like this:

1. **The Interviewers Viewpoint:**

   - How do we know if a candidate can code?
   - Let's test them on a coding problem!
   - ...does some Googling...
   - Here we are... we'll test them on fibonacci! I remember doing this 20 years
     ago, this is perfect.

2. **The Interviewee's Viewpoint:**

   - What the hell is fibonacci? Oh yeah... I remember that from school, along
     with a mass of other things that I've never used it in the real world...
   - What does coding a fibonacci have to do with _[insert company name here]_?
   - When would you ever need to use any of this code, it's not practical at
     all... am I interviewing to be a school teacher, or a software engineer? Or
     do they think this is a coding bootcamp that I need to graduate from?

The least the interviewer **should** do is make this _(very old)_ fibonacci
code challenge into something practical. **BONUS POINTS** if they can also make
it relate to their _[insert company name here]_, or to the day-to-day challenges
their current developers deal with. Even more **BONUS POINTS** if they also make
it fun.

The majority of these "coding quiz's" out there are never something you would
run into in the real world (at least in my 11 years of experience). The only
useful thing from "coding quiz's" is that they can be a good practice tool to
become faster at coding, at problem solving, and learning a new language. It is
NOT a good interview tool.

Please don't be mistaken, I'm not saying that coding quiz's are bad, I'm saying
that the way they're used in interviews is bad. Perhaps I can see these being
used when hiring a junior developer, but even then they shouldn't be boring,
"copy-pasted", or "ridiculous"; they should be practical, fun, and related to
the company's day-to-day challenges.

## The purpose of this repo

Perhaps I'm wrong about seeing these as **"ridiculous"** code quiz's, perhaps
the problem lies in how the question is asked, or the scenario of the question,
or the company that's asking the question?

What I want to explore in this repo is the possibilities of turning a
**"ridiculous"** code challenge into something **"practical"** (on a non-company
specific level).

The plus side of this repo is giving me practice at solving code quiz's (which
is the actual purpose of these challenges), while also exploring how to apply
these to actual day-to-day coding life. **BONUS POINTS** if I can work with
experts in different areas of the software world to get insight on why companies
ask some of these questions, and how they think they can be applied to real
scenarios that I haven't seen, or what they think could be done to make the
coding quiz portion of an interview better than it is.

### The plan

To help me focus more on this repo instead of searching the internet for code
challenges, I'll make use of my favorite Udemy instructor, Stephen Grider. He
has an excellent course ["The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures"](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WNk2@PUdgVFpSSFALckNGO0hOVD5u/)
that I'll use to quickly source my coding questions, which I will solve in a
different language than the course uses _(Javascript)_, and then explore how to
make these questions practical and fun.
